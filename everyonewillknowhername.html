      <h2>Everyone Will Know Her Name</h2>
        <h3>By: Kira Koziak</h3>
          <article id="stan11">
            <p>The name Karma imprinted itself on her skin.<br>A woman written in the pages of beauty and delight.<br>Shut in the hardcover of a book you can't bear to finish,<br>her name was read in the billions.<br>Karma's synonyms lied in the length of her skirt,<br>how many drinks closed her mind,<br>and her continuous smile.<br>She hid in the street lights from grinning shadows<br>with daggers between her knuckles.<br>Ready to battle her way to survive a pleasant stroll home.</p>

          <article id="stan12">
            <p>A man called Karma a bitch.<br>The bitch who bit back when he pulled her tail.<br>But her bark echoed in fury creating an army to take to war.<br>Caught in a whirlwind of social condemnation,<br>he called her a bitch when she refused<br>the touch that snaked its way to her flesh.<br>Having not realized her skin left a scar<br>branded on his reputation.</p>

          <article id="stan13">
            <p>Karma's key for the revenge against those who wronged<br>relish in the words parading in the air.<br>Now awake, she demolished the chains holding her over the cliff.<br>Her wings spread with fury in her words.<br>Now nothing held her back.<br>When she set herself on fire to keep them warm,<br>the shadows thought she would burn in the malice.<br>But she flew with her feathers over the ones who scorned her.<br>Ready the demons and angels, Karma's war has just begun.</p>
